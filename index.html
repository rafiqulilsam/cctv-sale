5 Benefits of Installing CCTV in Your Home
It’s not uncommon to see CCTV cameras situated on every corner of every building in commercial areas. As one of the easiest systems to set up, and one of the most cost-effective security systems, CCTV is used by almost every business to protect their property, and nowadays, they’re becoming a more frequent occurrence on homes too, with our team alone installing domestic CCTV 4-5 times a week.

 

CCTV can dramatically increase the security of your property and keep your family protected, so we’ve put together our top 5 benefits of installing CCTV in your home to help give you incentive to install CCTV to your premises:

1. Insurance deductions
While financial gain probably isn’t your number one motivator for installing a security system, it is certainly an added bonus that can make CCTV seem more appealing! When evaluating your insurance policy, the security of your property plays a huge impact on the amount of money you will pay, so by taking steps to make your property more secure and reduce the likelihood of your property being damaged or vandalised, you are in turn reducing the likelihood of you making a claim, allowing your insurance provider to reduce your policy costs.

2. Visual crime deterrent
CCTV can act as a huge deterrent to criminals, especially when it comes to pre-planned crimes. This means that thieves are much less likely to target your home, helping keep your belongings secure and increasing the safety of your family. To make the most of your CCTV, clearly advertise its presence on your property to ensure that unwanted guests stay well away.

3. Allows you to monitor the perimeter of your property from the safety of your home
CCTV can be set up at various blind spots around your home that you can’t see from your windows so that if you hear an unusual noise or would like some extra peace of mind, you can check the perimeter of your property without having to leave your home. Not only is this more safe, it is also less stressful. Another good use of CCTV is to use as a peephole for homes that are without them – if you receive a visitor late at night and are unsure who it could be, you can identify the visitor without having to answer the door. This is particularly useful for vulnerable individuals such as the elderly.

4. Can help identify criminals
CCTV is not just a preventative system, it can also help bring criminals to justice. If the worst was to happen and your property was robbed, damaged or vandalised, or if another criminal event took place in the vicinity of your cameras then your CCTV footage can be given to the police to help find and identify the culprits, bringing about some much needed justice and helping keep the streets safer for everyone.

5. Require little maintenance
Another fantastic benefit of CCTV over many other security measures is that they require next to no maintenance. Once installed, you can rely on them to protect and monitor your home and family for years to come, simply requiring the occasional wipe clean and check-up from a professional team.
